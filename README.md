# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System
This Python script utilizes the Face Recognition library along with OpenCV to create a real-time attendance system based on facial recognition.
The system captures video from a webcam and identifies faces within the frame, comparing them against a pre-defined set of known faces. 
Upon recognition, the script marks the attendance of the identified individuals and records the timestamp in a CSV file for later reference.
